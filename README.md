Example of using PyQt5 for a simple GUI application.

This simple program provides an example of how to create your main application window and add and organize the different parts of your GUI. 
Seperated into two different modules you will find a class showing how to create your main application window(app_window.py) and add some nice things like a status bar and tool bar. In app_widget.py you will find a class that gives examples of different types of widgets and buttons available in PyQt5, all nicely organized in a central widget using a layout. For the radio buttons, one of the slider bars, and some of the toolbar buttons you can see very simple examples of linking actions such as button clicks to functions.
